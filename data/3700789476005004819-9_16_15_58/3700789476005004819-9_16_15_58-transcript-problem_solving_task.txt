[F_cl_1]
I think so...

[F_cl_2]
Honestly, I don't, in this case, I'm not referring to tradespace, and referring to what I know. 

[F_cl_3]
[inaudible] ...

[F_cl_4]
Yes that is true, I remember that.

[F_cl_5]
Yes, correct...

[F_cl_6]
This one, I don't know. I'm going to guess.

[F_cl_7]
No I remember that SAR_ALTIM was always on its own. But I don't remeber the orbit honestly. Well, I think it's false but not really confident.

[F_cl_8]
I don't know...

[F_cl_9]
[inaudible] I think [inaudible]

[F_pwc_1]
I think it's this one.

[F_pwc_2]
I have really no insight on this SSO-600-DD, it didn't come to my radar, so I really don't know.

[F_pwc_3]
Let's see this can help. So these are classes. These are radars. These are lidars. I'm looking at the text. Ok. This one.

[F_pwc_4]
I don't have the information, I think.

[F_pwc_5]
This one's quite clear.

[F_pwc_6]
This one I'm not sure.

[F_pwc_7]
I'm not sure why I didn't get this.

[F_pwc_8]
Again (not sure)

[F_pwc_9]
Don't have that information

[D_cl_1]
Yes I think it is. It's a big one, middle one, and small one.

[D_cl_2]
Ah... no. This is no because SAR is always alone.

[D_cl_3]
This one I really don't know.

[D_cl_4]
Yeah I think this one is.

[D_cl_5]
Yes. SAR_ALTIM is alone

[D_cl_6]
Ah... No.

[D_cl_7]
I'm using SAR_ALTIM as a reference here.

[D_cl_8]
...

[D_cl_9]
No, it seems to be too many instruments.

[D_pwc_1]
I think this is closer.

[D_pwc_2]
This one.

[D_pwc_3]
