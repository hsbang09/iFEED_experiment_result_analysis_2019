Ok.. usually, SAR_ALTIM is somewhere. Let's see if I'm right.

Ok.. so it's moving well. Let's put more. 

... I like it here... better..


Ok.. let me look at what I had here.

AERO_LID... and... ok... it should fly low.



...


Basically what I'm doing here is design of experiment.

I'm trying to add instruments and trying to get as close as possible to the blue region.

If I have an instruments that brings to right, I will keep it here.

And I'm just doing experiments. And I'm trying to learn by experiment.

I don't have enough information myself to make it a real exercise where I am thinking the physics of the problem, I would say.

I'm just looking at the labels and I'm just playing. And see what brings me better science.

Some point I'm going to try to be more systematic in the way I do this. Now it's now more of really a.. let's play and see.

Oh.. that is a nice one.

I will start with this thing here.
