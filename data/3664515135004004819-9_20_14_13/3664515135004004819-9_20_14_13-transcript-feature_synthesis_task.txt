[START]

I need to create features, so...

So I think in terms of number of orbits, I think I missed the number of orbits before.

So the number of orbits I think... uh... in the target region were considerably less.

So this gave a point... so this is not the case. Oh five is the maximum.

So this region of [inaudible] average...

So this has again low specificity. Same like before.

So I saw a lot of uh... I think I saw a couple of vegetation insruments together in the LEO orbit.

So let me... try to specify ... LEO polar...

[Participant asks the experimenter what emptyOrbit means] 

Ok.. that is not what I want to do.

One of the orbits in the target region was not used. But I'm not sure which orbit it was. 

So I'm trying to... uh... 

Ok so this point... this maybe the orbit.

I will try to specify a condition on one instrument which must be used.

So I think a... I did see the CHEM_UVSPEC. 

Ok so this did improve the specificity, but coverage is low.

I think maybe... 

[Experiment lets the participant know tha numOrbits[4] means the number of orbits is exactly 4]

I want to put many OR, and then put AND condition.

Ok let me add...  let me add one more...

Ok so this I think specifies the number of orbits 1 to 4, and ...

Let me go to the best case... so this is... hmm

I'll try something different. Hmm.. number of instruments. 

I think there must be a minimum of 5 instruments. And maximum of 20 instruments.
