[START]

So, when I put the SAR_ALTIM, it seems like it satisfies almost all the target region but also the non-target region. 

So I'm trying to add an AND condition.

So I am browsing through some points, to see if uh... yeah there's some differentiator between the non-target and the target region.

I think in the target region, there are at least... or the maximum number of instruments seems to be six or seven.

So, I will try to add a constraint on the maximum number of instruments. Let me put it as... say five.

And the new condition... and what we see here is...

Ok... I think the point has low coverage. Oh.. this is not what we want.

Ok so with this, with the altimeter, it has high coverage, but less specificity... ok.

So if we apply this filter (numInstrumentsInOrbit[0,5]) ... ok let me add a child node.. a condition with the SAR... presence of SAR_ALTIM.

Ok so this gives the point here. 

So adding the SAR_ALTIM did not make much difference because both the points are ... so the one with the condition on the number of instruments and the SAR_ALTIM are very close. 

Ok now I'm trying to see some features of the non-target region, so that I can filter out... and be more specific.

So what I'm trying to do is ... to search for the reason why these points are in the target region. With the high science and low cost value.

So some points here have like six...

As the science value increases it seems the number of instruments is also increasing.

So with the low science value, the number of instruments... but there are some cases that even large number of instruments ...

Ok so I think this case corresponds to one with the total number of instruments being less ... of the entire architecture.

So let me apply another constraint on the total number of instruments over entire architecture. 

And let it be the lower bound of 5, and the upper bound of... so there are about 5 orbits per architecture... so 5 times 5... 25. Let me put 25 and see.

Ok so this gave a point over here. So this has high coverage, but low specificity again.

So I think I need to apply another condition on top of this condition to increase the specificity. 

So these points correspond to low cost, so I'm trying to think why these points have low cost. 

Maybe they have much lesser number of instruments ... [inaudible]

So let me modify this and decrease the maximum number of instruments. 

That seems to have improved specificity but only a tiny bit.

Let me modify it more. Let me decrease it more.. say 15.

So the specificity is still about 18%. 

So it needs to ... so it seems like the target region is over here. The target region which is covered by this condition... There's a subset over here. On the lower left, but not on the upper right.

So if I can get rid of the common feature which is there in these architectures, then maybe I can increase the specificity.

So I am searching for some common feature...

Ok so the number of instruments seem to be more for all of this.

And it seems that... uh... these architectures are carrying instruments of more than... of the same type... uh... carrying multiple instruments of the same type.

So I will try applying a filter on the max... say the type of the instruments. And restrict the type of the... So I want to apply a filter which will restrict only one type of instrument per architecture.

[Experimenter explains that there's no filter that can do exactly what the participant wants, and suggests using Separate]

So let me see...

[inaudible]

So let's say we have the ocean... so let me apply VEG_INSAR and VEG_LID. I'm not sure what is LID. But let me apply that.

So let me add this condition to this... So I'll add a child node with another condition of Separate.

Let me add INSAR and VEG_LID. Ok so this is not doing so good.

It decreased the coverage but it did not improve the specificity.

So for example, in this orbit, we have the CHEM_UVSPEC in three orbits... Yeah in this architecture, we have like CHEM_UVSPEC in three orbits. 

Oh ok... there are some... there is one orbit with two CHEM_UVSPEC. That looks strange.

Ok let me restrict the number of CHEM_UVSPEC... Number of instruments... ok... CHEM_UVSPEC and I select one to... zero to one.

Ok this does not look good.

Let go back and find... or... let me modify the condition. I'll specify the number of instruments in orbit.

[inaudible] number of instruments... This improved the coverage, but it did not improve the specificity.

But I think we have a way to restrict the type of instruments... the number of types of instruments over an architecture. 

So I select numOfInstruments, and I select one instrument...

[Participant asks a question about the filter and the experiment explains]

[Applies filter numInstruments[OCE_SPEC;0-1]]

I will add the next instrument separately.

[Applies filter numInstruments[ACE_POL;0-1]]

It seems to be... increasing the specificity.

So what I'm trying to do is to add all instruments.

So it seems to be increasing the specificity.

[Applies filter numInstruments[AERO_LID; 0-1]]
[Applies filter numInstruments[HYP_ERB; 0-1]]

... ah no. In this case, it didn't do good.

[Experiment adivses the participant to start recording info on concept map page]
[Records new info on concept map: "Multiple instrument of same type in same architecture in the non-target region."]

I'm trying to add more conditions.
 
[Records new info on concept map: "Restricting the number of same types look to increase specificity marginally"]
[Experiment advises the participant that they can use "copyTextDescription" option to easily copy and paste info]

So it seems... I'm seeing a lot of CHEM_UVSPEC. So for CHEM_UVSPEC, I will increase the minimum number of instruments, 

But.. ah... no. But it will decreases the specificity.

So let me go back to the original [inaudible].. and add child node.

So this improved the specificity. 

[inaudible]

So I want... 1 and 2. Ah no. So 1 and 2 is very sub-optimal.

So changing... so applying this CHEM_UVSPEC condition improved the specificity much more.
