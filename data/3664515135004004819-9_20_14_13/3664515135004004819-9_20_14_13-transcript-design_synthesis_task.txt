[START]

I think I saw a couple of vegetation instruments in polar, so I'll assign them here, and uh...

So the ocean spectrometer... I'm not sure about that.

But the... CHEM_UVSPEC... I think I saw it in the second and the last. 

[inaudible] maybe... fourth orbit. 

And uh... I saw the SAR_ALTIM again in the first orbit.

HYP_IMAG... so... 

I think... I have 6 instruments.

So in the last orbit, I think I saw the UVSPEC, and the HIRES_SOUND... and the... SWIR.

Ok let me evaluate this thing.

Ok so this shows that the science value is less but the cost is also less.

So I need to increase the science value. So.. how do we do that..

So in case of the... I think I'll input the AERO_POL and lidar. So I add two more instruments.

Ok so this increased the science value, but the... cost is almost the same.

So I will try to bring down the cost. By maybe moving one of the satellite... the instrument.

Ok so that did not make much difference. But.. uh... that looks strange.

So let me remove... 

So the science value did not change, and the cost came down marginally.

Let me add uh... let me try to remove one of the UV spectrometers. The first one from this orbit.

So that did not do good. So I will add it back.

And remove it from this orbit.

Ok that too did not do good. So I will add it back.

So ocean spectrometer... not complete sure which orbit to put it into, but let me try this.

Ok so the science value increased, but the cost is still high.

So let me try to remove maybe one of some instrument. 

But that is not good.

[inaudible]

Let me remove this instrument. So I am trying to bring down cost. [inaudible]

Let me add a UV spectrometer here. Ok so it did increase the science value... hmm...

So maybe adding... ok so it did not increase science but it increased the cost. 

Let me try a different type of isntrument. Hmm.. no.

So I reduce it to just three orbits.

So cost does reduce, but not so much. Let me try to... uh...

Let me try to put many instruments.
