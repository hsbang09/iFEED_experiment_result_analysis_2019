I think two radars can be assigned to the same orbit.

[Experimenter explained to the participant that this survey is asking only preference]

Ok so I think the second option is more useful information, because it specifies the instrument types... I think it's the first option because it applies to many different instruments. Which need not be those specific types but can still be radars.

[2]
So in the second case too, following the same reason.

[3]
In the third case too.

[4]
I think the first case is better because, it is short and it summarizes information more efficiently.

[5]
I think the first case filters out... uh... I think both are useful. Hmm... maybe the second case.

[6]
I think the first case carries more useful information.

[7]
In this case, I think it's the second option... Yeah this is uh... the second option gives the way to build architecture, instead of something negative.

[8]
Even in this case, it's still the first option. Because it specifies the way to directly build architecture.

[9]
In this case, I think it is the first option, because I think the altimeter was being used... prior knowledge for me.
